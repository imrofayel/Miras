North America, Japan, and Korea – when it comes to fighting games, the frontier is dominated by these three regions. But in 2019 Pakistan surprised everyone when they proved they had some of the best *Tekken* players in the world. 

<div class="py-2"></div>

The world stood agape as the 23-year-old nobody from the least likely of places beat the pros at their own game. So, how did Pakistan a country that doesn't even have official distributors for PlayStation or Xbox, good enough to beat the best in the world.

<div class="py-2"></div>

This is the story of *Arslan Ash Siddique*, the indomitable spirit of a nation that refused to be defined by its circumstances.

<div class="py-2"></div>

Pakistani passport ranked the fourth lowest for visiting other countries which is why Arslan Ash got stuck in transit for three days on his way to winning *Evo Japan*.

<div class="py-2"></div>

Arslan Ash’s journey began in the humble arcades of Lahore. Growing up in a country facing numerous challenges, he found solace in the world of video games.

<div class="py-2"></div>

Back in 2008, as a 12-year-old pre-teen, he first got pulled into the vibrantly coloured and highly engaging world of gaming. At the time, he owned no computer and had access to no video gaming console at home, so he would rush to the gaming center to play for at least five hours after school every day.

<div class="py-2"></div>

In 2012, he won his first national competition and by 2018, he had qualified to at least 40 national level rounds, gaining numerous local competition wins along the way, as well. However, these national level tournaments were not enough to crown Siddique as a Tekken prodigy.

<div class="py-2"></div>

It was at the FV Cup x SEA Major 2018 in Malaysia that he got his first taste of an international competition. He earned 9th position and a growing appetite for bigger wins. In the summer of 2018, vSlash eSports, a professional gamers group based in the Middle East signed ‘Ash’ to participate in the Omni Universal Gaming (OUG) Tournament. With the group-covered sponsorship, overseas travel to Dubai became possible this time around. It was here that he defeated the seventh best Tekken 7 player in the world at the time, Knee, by a score of 3-0. Ash had quickly outdone his respectable performance of Malaysia.

<div class="py-2"></div>

Despite these wins under his belt, many from the community were not quick to acknowledge his abilities. They felt his wins were an off-chance; a fluke not based on any unique or special style of fighting at a high-level. 

<div class="py-2"></div>

In order to win the respect he knew he deserved, and plant his flag on international territories, Arslan would have to travel overseas again – this time to Fukuoka, Japan. The tournament, while being smaller than its U.S. counterpart was still a show of gigantic proportions with its 6 categories attracting 2,500 entrants from the Eastern hemisphere.

<div class="py-2"></div>

First, due to issues related to the paperwork, his visa was delayed to the extent where concerns started to grow that he would not make it in time. 

<div class="py-2"></div>

Once the visa arrived, unexpectedly, he bounced from airport to airport for days, reaching Japan with no way to exchange his Rupees to buy himself food.  

<div class="py-2"></div>

The situation was so desperate that 4 hours before the tournament, instead of being in Fukuoka, Arslan found himself sitting at the airport in Tokyo with little to no sleep, having gone hungry for a day, and talking to his sponsors about booking a flight back home to Pakistan.   

<div class="py-2"></div>

Instead of a flight back home, he miraculously managed to head to the tournament that had already started. At the onset, he kept defeating opponent after opponent, but he was still practically a nobody, and went undefeated but unnoticed for a while.

<div class="py-2"></div>

While Ash won against Knee, since he had no camera on him, not many knew whom Knee had lost to. But that was about to change as one after another, he continued to knock out almost every Korean player, including the big names from the game.

<div class="py-2"></div>

Finally, it was the clash of the defending EVO champion against the newbie; the favourite powerhouse against the boy functioning without sleep. The results were unbelievable. He kept eliminating the celebrated players from Japan and the U.S. 

<div class="py-2"></div>

He had earned respect but not the title of the ultimate champion, yet. That had to be scooped up only after lifting the gigantic boulder of defeating the best from Philippines – AK.  

<div class="py-2"></div>

Perhaps, in a different world, EVO Japan would have been the story of how AK bagged the much-coveted victory for his region, also underrated in the world of pro Tekken. But that day belonged to Arslan Ash – the man on fire. The Tekken character Kazumi became his lucky charm yet again, manifesting his skill, and fighting her way to victory for him.

<div class="py-2"></div>

EVO Japan not only catapulted Arslan Siddique into world recognition as a champion, but also placed Pakistan on the map. Tekken player, Knee, tweeted how he wanted to come to Pakistan to train for Tekken, seconded by Chanel who wished the same.

<div class="py-2"></div>

Japan went on to arrange a series of matches between Arslan and ten of their best to see how he would fare. Arslan beat them all.

<div class="py-2"></div>

Siddique left everyone stunned after being crowned the champion of Tekken 7 at the world’s biggest fighting game tournament, EVO 2019, in Las Vegas. 

<div class="py-2"></div>

After successfully fighting his way through the two pool rounds and the semi-finals Siddique made his way to the final round where he faced off against 7 top professional gamers from 3 different countries. Pitted against South Korea’s Knee once again, Arslan came out as the champion after delivering a remarkable victory.

<div class="py-2"></div>

His consistent performance over the years has earned him multiple championships, including EVO Japan 2019, EVO 2019 (Las Vegas), EVO Japan 2023, EVO 2023 (Las Vegas), EVO 2024 (Las Vegas).

<div class="py-2"></div>

In July 2024, Arslan won his fifth EVO title by defeating fellow Pakistani player Atif Butt in the Tekken 8 tournament at EVO 2024 in Las Vegas and proved himself as the God of Taken.

<div class="py-2"></div>

Arslan’s success continued to grow, and he became a household name in the world of competitive gaming. His victories were not just personal triumphs but also a source of national pride for Pakistan.

<div class="py-2"></div>

Arslan’s success has had a profound impact on Pakistan. His victories have inspired a new generation of gamers and sparked conversations about the potential of esports in the country. Arslan’s story became a beacon of hope, showing that with talent and perseverance, anything is possible.

Long live Pakistan! Long live Arslan Ash!
