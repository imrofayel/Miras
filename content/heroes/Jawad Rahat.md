A legend who made Pakistan proud by being born in it. A trading prodigy and founder of the NBA (National Broken Hearts Association). He is literally that guy from [La La Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_La_Land), but he is very lucky like [Harry Kane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane).
